Technology has become an integral part of our everyday lives and has made our day-to-day lives and activities more comfortable, faster, and more efficient.

The world is changing at a rapid pace, with technology as both a constant and a catalyst. The word ‚Äútechnology‚Äù is mainly used in the Engineering and Information Technology space. It serves as the backbone or a supporting role in every other field.

Technology has advanced to the level wherein some countries (like the US, China) have a checkout-free shopping mall where you go in, shop for items, and pay for the stuff you want to buy without interacting with a cashier or mall attendant. We also have self-driving cars, which are capable of sensing their environment and operating without human involvement.


With the advancement of technology, our lives have been greatly improved. This also comes with some drawbacks and disadvantages in sectors that were heavily dependent on manual labor. Though we have seen a decline in the industry that is dependent on manual labor, on the other hand, there has been an increase in job opportunities in the sectors that are heavily driven by technology.

Transitioning into tech from another field can be pretty confusing at first; I can say this because I transitioned from the accounting and finance field to working as a Front-end Developer. Not to worry, this book will help you figure out how to transition to tech smoothly and build a successful career.

## Who is this book for?
This book is for you if you can answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to any of the following questions:

Are you from a non-tech field and looking to build a career in tech?

Are you a computer science graduate looking to join the software industry?

Are you looking at exploring the tech industry?

Are you a high school graduate looking to gain skills in tech?

Are you a college graduate looking to gain new skills to enhance your income?

Are you a professional looking for other possibilities?

Are you looking for a well-paying job?

Are you looking for secure work and excellent prospects?

Then, this book is for you.

## Why should you consider a tech career?

Let‚Äôs go through some crucial reasons why you should consider a career in tech.

### High demand
Almost every sector now requires you to have tech skills. Many companies have moved from manual ways of doing things to making use of the computer. As the world of technology continues to evolve, the demand for tech skills becomes higher.

There is a shortage of talent in the tech industry, which means there are more job opportunities than people 
to occupy these roles. This also means that there will always be a demand for tech skills.

### High salaries
People with tech experience tend to get higher salaries than their colleagues in other fields. Tech skills are crucial and valuable to many businesses. So when it comes to financial compensation, the pay is usually higher than in other industries. Some of the highest-paid jobs are in the tech industry. Even the average salary of an entry-level position is higher when compared to the average salary in other industries.

### A variety of career opportunities
Tech is not an isolated industry. It overlaps with every other sector, which makes it a versatile career opportunity. You can venture into any career in tech you are comfortable with. Tech jobs have a vast array of career possibilities that stem from software engineering, people managers, product managers, product design, technical recruiters, etc.

The number of possibilities means that every person can develop a tech career that perfectly suits their needs and interests, which leads to the ultimate goal: genuine job satisfaction. With tech careers available in nearly every field, you have many opportunities open to you.

You can work in the IT department at a major financial institution, write code for a software development company, and even help imagine and
bring to life the next generation of technology ‚Äî the possibilities are truly endless.

### Flexibility
Tech careers have flexible jobs that can be carried out in any part of the world. As technology advances, jobs are becoming more flexible.

The 2020 global pandemic taught us that the future of work is remote.
Companies that didn‚Äôt allow employees to work from home before the pandemic now see good evidence that people can work from home and still be productive. They also save on administrative costs like rent, electricity bills, internet bills, etc. Some tech companies adopted remote working long before the pandemic, but many more companies were forced to adopt it due to the pandemic.

### High growth rate
The growth rate in the tech industry is high and can‚Äôt be compared with other career fields. When you start a tech career, you will most likely start from an entry-level position and move to mid-level / intermediate levels before moving into senior roles and managerial roles.

The rate at which you move from an entry-level to intermediate is solely dependent on you. It is determined by the effort you put into your work and your capability to manage your tasks and problem-solving skills. It is possible to move from an entry-level to a senior level within a few years, but remember, it all depends on your effort.

### Low Educational Costs
Transitioning into a tech career requires little to no cost. The tech industry requires you to have a unique set of practical skills to qualify for a position. Candidates usually have to demonstrate the right amount of technical expertise and provide experience.

Computer science and other IT-related degrees provide you with the foundation for a successful career in the industry. Nevertheless, it has been proven that people have been able to excel without formal education by using other alternatives routes like Bootcamps and self-learning (using books, video tutorials, and other related materials) to acquire the necessary knowledge. So, anyone with enough passion for starting a career in tech can achieve it with minimal cost.

### Entrepreneurial Training Ground
Tech has been the proving ground of entrepreneurship. Those with great ideas, a vision, soft skills, and a great work ethic can utilize technology to create world-changing products. Entrepreneurs with a technology skillset founded companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and many other thriving businesses. You necessarily don‚Äôt need to code to own a tech company. All you need is the ability to solve a societal problem and execute it with the resources available to you.

## Conclusion
In this introductory section, you have seen how technology has become an increasing part of our lives, how it is being used to solve societal problems. We have also seen the importance of technology, what the industry offers you, and why you should consider a tech career today.
