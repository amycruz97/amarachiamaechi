While rejection is typically a part of life, some types of rejection may be more difficult to cope with than others.

The hardest part about rejection is making you believe a piece of you failed at something, it makes you feel like you are not good enough.

Alternatively, stop being hard on yourself when rejection comes in, you can use it as an opportunity to better yourself and prepare for the next big opportunity that is about to happen.

Rejection breaks the heart, it can also destroy your self-esteem and self-confidence. It makes you question your worth and competence. But having the right mindset will change how you feel about rejection.

I remember when I was starting out my career as a Front-End developer who just graduated from the university with no prior experience, I was seeking for opportunities to improve my skills.

I made over 50 applications, I didn't get feedback from some of the applications, which are actually not good, while some, I was given constructive feedback which helped me look at rejection from a different perspective.

How I was able to deal with rejection and kept on applying until I finally landed a role will be dealt with later on.

There are ways you can deal with rejection that can help you come out a stronger and better person.

## Ways to deal with rejection

<br>

### 🔵 Stop overthinking
People process rejection in different ways, for some people it is a tough time in their life, while some take it as part of life and move on. During that period of rejection, some people think their way into depression, they start blaming themselves, they also start feeling like a failure. But this is not the time to start thinking and throwing blame on ourselves but a time to be kind to ourselves and move ON.

### 🔵 Engage in healthy habits
When Rejection occurs, we tend to beat ourselves up over the things that might have led us to be rejected. A lot of people start practicing unhealthy habits which might be a result of the misery. Engaging in healthy habits like eating a balanced diet, exercising frequently, and staying hydrated can help you stay strong.

### 🔵 Spend time with loved ones and do things you love.
The time you are dealing with rejection is the best time to spend with people you love, things you love, and the things you love doing. This helps you shift your focus for a while. Doing things you love comes in different ways, Personally, I love watching movies, trying out new food recipes, etc. this helps me relax and shift my focus while I go through the rejection phase.

### 🔵 Say no to the inner critic.
The inner critic is that still small voice that drones or whisper in your mind about how incompetent, inefficient, unattractive, unintelligent, or perhaps that you’re unsuccessful in life. and that’s what got you rejected. When you notice this voice starting to pipe up in your mind shut it down before it have a negative effect on your thought process.
You can shut the inner critic in your mind, by using the popular quote from Game of throne movie “NOT TODAY”.


### 🔵 Give yourself time to heal
It is okay to take a break, a day off work, or off your regular schedule won't be a bad idea. Give yourself time to heal and process. But make sure that you don’t go overboard and spend days sitting in your house wallowing in your misery. That will only make you feel worse in the long run.

### 🔵 Stay Positive
Staying positive during this period is one of the hardest things to do.
Trying to force optimism or to move forward when you are still in an emotional turmoil or a bit shocked usually doesn’t work that well.

But you can stay positive by coming up with a list of your strengths and values and some things you have achieved even when it seems you won't be able to achieve it. You can stay positive by starting your day with a positive affirmation about yourself.

### 🔵 Take it as an opportunity
Sometimes rejection can be an important wake-up call and can help you improve your life.
If there’s one important skill to learn from rejection, it’s that you should never let it stop you from your future endeavors. Getting rejected is just an inevitable part of life, after all, every single successful person we know has experienced it.

### 🔵 Remember that rejection is temporary, not permanent (if you keep going).
Something you need to remember at all times is that the letters N and O in ‘No’ doesn’t mean No Opportunity, but it means NEXT OPPORTUNITY. It all depends on how you view and percepts life.

Let's look at some success stories of how people got rejected several times until they finally got accepted.

I will leave a quote by Seth Godin

>“They didn't reject you,
They rejected an application, They rejected a business plan, They rejected a piece of paper.
They don't know you”.
